## Start of tutorial
### Hi, I am your first note (Tutorial start.md file) inside the vault Obsidian How-To (Obsidian name for directory) you just opened! If you can edit me, then click on  "Preview mode" (TR corner [^1][^2]), to toggle between edit and preview mode

#### Anyways I wonder what is inside [[Second]] ... (maybe I should click on this internal link?)

[^1]: At least in the latest Obsidian version on the day when I wrote this tutorial ... 
[^2]: If you don't see this option, maybe you have it disabled. In that case view [[Most important Obsidian settings (BL)]]
